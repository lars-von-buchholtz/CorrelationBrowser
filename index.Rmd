## Detecting correlations between columns in a data frame


- a prerequisite for a successful regression analysis or feature design for machine learning is 
exploratory data analysis
- correlation between numeric or factor variables that are organized in columns in a dataframe is of particular interest

--- .class #id 

## Problem: Pairs plots get too small and cluttered on large dataframes

```{r pairs plot, echo = F}
data(mtcars)
pairs(mtcars)
```  
  

---

## Solution: An interactive tool to display individual pair plots


- columns of the dataframe can be selected for the x and y axes

- data frames can be uploaded as csv files

- if no csv file is uploaded the mtcar data set is displayed

## Just try it out!!!
